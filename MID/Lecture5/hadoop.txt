1- Download Hadoop 1.1.1 binary. Mirror

Extract it to a folder on your computer:

 $ tar xvfz hadoop-1.1.1.tar.gz

2- Setup JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the directory where Java is installed. For my Mac OS X, I did the following:

 $ export JAVA_HOME=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6.0/Home
Note: If you are running Lion, you may want to update the JAVA_HOME to point to java_home command which outputs Java's home directory, that is,

 $ export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)

3- Setup HADOOP_INSTALL environment variable to point the directory where you extracted hadoop binary in step 2:

 $ export HADOOP_INSTALL=/Users/umermansoor/Documents/hadoop-1.1.1
Edit the PATH environment variable:

 $ export PATH=$PATH:$HADOOP_INSTALL/bin
Or you can add these variables to your standard shell script. For example, ~/.bash_profile
